# Tracking persons

In the project, you will explore deep learning techniques for object tracking with Deep Sort [4] and face recognition with facenet [5]. You will have the chance to build an application based on the current state-of-the-art computer vision techniques (such as Deep Sort and facenet) and experiment with your own novel designs. 
The goal of this project is to build a tracking system for aged care. We have provided starter links with source codes and related papers. At the same time, we will provide the virtual environment setup, i.e., anaconda environment. Your job is designing a framework to connect tracking process and face recognizing process.

# Stage I
  - Literature Review
  - Computer Vision basic concept
  - Self-learning Python
  - Run a deep sort demo

# Stage II

  - Face recognization with facenet

# Stage III

  - Label tracked persons with recoginzed tracker's name
